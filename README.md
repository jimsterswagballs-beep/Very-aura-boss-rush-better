# Boss Rush — Lore, Boss Combat & Phase 4.5 Update

This is the **flat-file** edition. Keep `index.html`, all `.png` files, and all `.mp3` files together in the repository root. The game does not require an `assets/` folder. Keep every filename unchanged.

## Publish with GitHub Pages

1. Upload all files in this folder to the root of your GitHub repository (not into a nested folder).
2. Commit the files.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, select **Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder `/(root)`.
4. Open the published Pages URL and hard-refresh with `Ctrl+F5`.

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow keys** — move
- **Mouse / Click** — aim and attack
- **Q / E / R** — character abilities
- **H** — show or hide collision hitboxes
- **M** — mute or unmute
- **P** — pause in solo boss fights
- **1 / 2 / 3** — select an upgrade

Audio playback starts after the first click or key press because browsers require a user interaction before audio can play. The Phase 4.5 visualizer reads the soundtrack's live frequency data when the browser's Web Audio API is available.

## Update highlights

- Revised story continuity: UnCoolguy16's broken regulator causes the pressure pulse; Evil Spong's bubble wards contain the flood; the core creates two combat echoes; defeating them begins the timed purge; Evil Zach is the core's final player-like combat echo.
- Boss health increased across the roster.
- Each boss has extra attack patterns. Evil Spong's active attack pool is bubble-based: aimed bubble sprays, pressure mines, radial waves, bubble prisons, rotating bubble patterns, tsunami volleys, bubble meteors, tornadoes, popping bubbles, geysers, and refraction volleys.
- Boss 4's two enemies have separate health bars and use their original solo attack pools, with additional coordinated duo attacks.
- Phase 4.5 is a 93.179-second survival phase timed to the supplied *Overdue* MP3. It cycles through eight map-wide attack patterns, updates warnings, hazards, and projectiles during the phase, and draws a live audio-reactive spectrum with additional arena effects.
- Evil Zach still evades player fire and now has additional knife patterns.

## Notes

The game uses PeerJS for online rooms and needs a working internet connection for the PeerJS library. The included game and media files are all intended to sit alongside `index.html` in the repository root.
